# Speech-to-Text Bubble Display Web App Requirements

Create a NextJS web application that transcribes speech in real-time using WhisperX and displays each word in individual bubbles with the following features:

## Core Functionality
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription using WhisperX
- Each transcribed word appears in its own distinct bubble
- Words automatically fade away after 2 seconds
- Users can click/tap a word to "pin" it (prevent fading)

## User Interface
- Prominent on/off toggle switch (green when active, red when inactive)
- Clean, minimalist design with focus on the word bubbles
- Visual indication when the system is actively listening
## User Experience 
- Zero setup required - users should be able to start speaking immediately after toggling on
- Smooth, natural-feeling animations for word appearance and fading
- Clear visual distinction between temporary and pinned words
- Consider how multiple pinned words should be organized on screen

## Additional Considerations
- Browser compatibility and microphone permission handling
